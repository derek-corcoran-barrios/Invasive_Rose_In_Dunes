<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of Invasive\_Rose\_In\_Dunes is to generate and clean a dataset
to study the influence of the species called *Rosa rugosa* in the
richness of positive species. The script to clean the dataset is
`Fitering.R`, and the final dataset is `Final.Rds`. This readme file is
in its initial state, thus it will be updated soon
