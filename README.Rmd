# Invasive_Rose_In_Dunes

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of Invasive_Rose_In_Dunes is to generate and clean a dataset to study the influence of the species called *Rosa rugosa* in the richness of positive species. The script to clean the dataset is `Fitering.R`, and the final dataset is `Final.Rds`. This readme file is in its initial state, thus it will be updated soon
